JP GROUP 1191100100 Analysis:

From auto-doc.pt specifications:
- Type: Electronic distributor with Hall sensor
- For: VW engines 1.6L/1.8L (1983-1992)
- OEM: 026905205AG, 027905205S, 027905205H, 027905205R
- Feature: "with vacuum regulator" (com regulador de vácuo)

Key question: Does it have CENTRIFUGAL advance?

Hall sensor distributors for VW ABU engines typically come in variants:
1. Hall sensor ONLY (fully electronic, no mechanical advance) - rare
2. Hall sensor + Vacuum advance (most common)
3. Hall sensor + Vacuum + Centrifugal (older design)

The JP GROUP listing says "with vacuum regulator" but does NOT mention centrifugal.
Modern Hall sensor distributors (1990s+) typically eliminated centrifugal weights.

For VW ABU 1.6L (1994-1999):
- Factory used electronic control units (ECU) for timing
- Distributors were simplified to Hall sensor + vacuum only
- Centrifugal advance was phased out in favor of ECU control

Conclusion: JP GROUP 1191100100 likely has:
✓ Hall sensor (confirmed)
✓ Vacuum advance (confirmed in listing)
? Centrifugal advance (UNLIKELY - not mentioned, modern design)

If it DOES have centrifugal:
- Springs/weights inside distributor body
- Adds 0-15° advance based on RPM
- Would interfere with Speeduino timing control
- BAD for Option 1 (even with vacuum disconnected)

If it does NOT have centrifugal:
- Only vacuum advance to worry about
- Disconnecting vacuum = fully static distributor
- GOOD for Option 1 (works like NTY)
