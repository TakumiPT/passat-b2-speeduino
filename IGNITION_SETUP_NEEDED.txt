IGNITION TIMING CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS - Passat B4 1.6L ABU
Golf 2 SPI 1.6L Brother Engine - Speeduino with Bosch Module 124
=================================================================

CURRENT CONFIGURATION (from CurrentTune.msq):
---------------------------------------------

✓ Trigger Pattern: "Basic Distributor" (correct for Hall sensor)
✓ Spark Mode: "Wasted Spark" (correct for single coil + distributor)
✓ Number of Cylinders: 4
✓ Ignition enabled: YES (Speeduino IS controlling timing!)

TIMING SETTINGS:
----------------
• CrankAng (Cranking timing): 5° BTDC
• TrigAng (Trigger angle offset): 0° ← PROBLEM #1!
• Ignition Algorithm: MAP-based
• Dwell (cranking): 4.5ms
• Dwell (running): 3.0ms

ADVANCE TABLE (advTable1):
--------------------------
Running timing: 14-40° BTDC depending on RPM/MAP
Idle (low RPM/low load): ~14-17° BTDC
Mid-range: 23-28° BTDC  
High load: 30-40° BTDC


CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:
==============================

PROBLEM #1: TRIGGER ANGLE NOT CALIBRATED
-----------------------------------------
Current: TrigAng = 0°

This is the ROOT CAUSE of your backfiring!

The TrigAng tells Speeduino WHERE cylinder #1 is in relation to the 
Hall sensor signal. With TrigAng = 0°, Speeduino thinks the sensor 
triggers at TDC, but your distributor likely triggers at a different 
position (maybe 60° or 90° before TDC).

Result: Speeduino fires spark at WRONG piston position!
- Thinks it's firing at 5° BTDC during cranking
- Actually firing at 65° BTDC (way too early!)
- This causes INTAKE BACKFIRES


PROBLEM #2: VACUUM ADVANCE INTERFERENCE
----------------------------------------
Your JP GROUP distributor has vacuum advance mechanism.

When Speeduino commands 5° during cranking, the distributor can add:
- Vacuum advance: 0-10° (depends on manifold vacuum)
- Total timing becomes unpredictable

During cranking, vacuum is high (closed throttle) so vacuum advance 
adds extra degrees Speeduino doesn't know about!


REQUIRED FIXES:
===============

FIX #1: CALIBRATE TRIGGER ANGLE (Critical - Must do first!)
------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURE:
1. In TunerStudio, go to: Spark Settings → Trigger Settings
2. Find "Trigger Angle" (TrigAng)
3. Enable "Fixed Timing" mode (usually 10° or 15° BTDC)
4. Start engine (will run rough at fixed timing)
5. Use timing light on cylinder #1 spark plug wire
6. Point timing light at crankshaft pulley timing marks
7. Read actual timing on pulley (e.g., shows 35° but should be 15°)
8. Calculate offset: Offset = Commanded - Actual
   Example: 15° commanded - 35° actual = -20° offset
9. Set TrigAng = offset value (e.g., TrigAng = -20)
10. Re-check with timing light (should now match commanded timing)
11. Disable fixed timing mode
12. Restart - engine should run normally

EXPECTED RESULT:
- For VW ABU distributor, TrigAng typically -60° to -90°
- This compensates for distributor rotor position
- Speeduino will now fire spark at correct piston position


FIX #2: DISABLE VACUUM ADVANCE (Critical for Speeduino control!)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

OPTION A: Disconnect vacuum line (Temporary test)
- Locate vacuum line from intake manifold to distributor
- Disconnect and plug both ends
- Test start

OPTION B: Remove vacuum advance mechanism (Permanent)
- Remove distributor cap
- Unscrew vacuum canister from distributor body
- Leave linkage disconnected
- Reinstall cap

OPTION C: Buy NTY distributor without vacuum (€40)
- No vacuum advance = cleaner Speeduino control
- Plug and play replacement
- Recommended for long-term solution


FIX #3: ADJUST CRANKING TIMING (After fixing #1 and #2)
--------------------------------------------------------

Current: CrankAng = 5° BTDC

For Golf 2 / Passat B4 1.6L ABU cold start:
- Recommended: 10° BTDC during cranking
- More advance helps cold combustion
- Less likely to backfire than your current setup (once TrigAng fixed)

Change to: CrankAng = 10° 

NOTE: Only adjust this AFTER trigger angle is calibrated!


FIX #4: VERIFY ADVANCE TABLE (Optional optimization)
-----------------------------------------------------

Your advance table looks reasonable for Golf 2 SPI:
- Idle: 14-17° (good)
- Cruise: 25-30° (good)  
- WOT: 35-40° (aggressive but acceptable for stock engine)

These values are ONLY used during running (RPM > 300).
During cranking, only CrankAng (5°) is used.


TESTING PROCEDURE AFTER FIXES:
===============================

STEP 1: Calibrate Trigger Angle
- Use timing light method above
- Verify timing matches commanded values
- This is CRITICAL - don't skip!

STEP 2: Disconnect Vacuum Advance
- Unplug vacuum line
- Plug hose ends

STEP 3: Set Cranking Timing to 10° BTDC
- Change CrankAng from 5 to 10
- Save tune

STEP 4: Test Cold Start
- Temperature: 15°C or similar
- Battery: Fully charged (12.6V)
- Log as teste8.mlg
- Expected: NO backfires, engine fires and runs smoothly

STEP 5: If Still Backfires
- Reduce cranking timing to 8° or 6°
- Or check if timing light calibration was correct


WHY THIS MATTERS FOR GOLF 2 SPI / PASSAT B4:
=============================================

Your engine is from the VW EA827 family (Golf 2 SPI 1.6L):
- Factory used Digifant ECU or similar for ignition control
- Distributor was ONLY a signal source + spark distributor
- Timing was controlled electronically by ECU
- Vacuum/centrifugal advances were NOT used (bypassed by ECU)

Your Speeduino setup is IDENTICAL to factory:
- Speeduino = Digifant ECU replacement
- Bosch Module 124 = Ignition amplifier (like factory)
- Distributor = Signal source only (like factory)

BUT: You need to disable vacuum advance (factory ECU did this too!)
AND: You need to calibrate trigger angle (factory did this at assembly!)


SUMMARY - IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
=============================

Priority 1: CALIBRATE TRIGGER ANGLE
- Use timing light
- Set TrigAng to correct offset (-60° to -90° typical)
- This fixes backfires!

Priority 2: DISCONNECT VACUUM ADVANCE  
- Unplug vacuum line
- Or buy NTY distributor (€40)

Priority 3: INCREASE CRANKING TIMING
- Change CrankAng from 5° to 10°
- Better cold start performance

Priority 4: TEST
- Log as teste8
- Verify no backfires
- Engine should fire and run smoothly


Your fuel system is already perfect (ASE 100/90/60/30%).
The ONLY remaining problem is ignition timing calibration!
