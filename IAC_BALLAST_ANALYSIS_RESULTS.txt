  START ATTEMPTS ANALYSIS: BALLAST RESISTOR & IAC BEHAVIOR
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TESTS PERFORMED:
- START 2: WITHOUT 6.8Ω ballast resistor (forgot to connect)
- START 3: WITH 6.8Ω ballast resistor
- START 4: WITHOUT 6.8Ω ballast resistor (removed again)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
KEY FINDINGS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. IAC IS MOVING NORMALLY
   ✓ Std Dev: 35.9 steps average (>10 = active)
   ✓ Range: 90-159 steps movement
   ✓ IAC motor is FUNCTIONAL

2. IAC NOT CONTROLLING RPM EFFECTIVELY
   ❌ RPM-IAC correlation near ZERO (should be negative -0.5 to -0.8)
   ❌ Target: 1050-1066 RPM
   ❌ Actual: 75-391 RPM (massive undershoot)
   ❌ IAC moving but engine not responding

3. BALLAST RESISTOR IMPACT
   WITH resistor (START 3):
     - IAC range reduced: 90 steps (vs 159 without)
     - RPM-IAC correlation: 0.179 (no effect)
     - Actual RPM: 75 RPM (worst case - almost stalled)
   
   WITHOUT resistor (START 2 & 4):
     - IAC range full: 159 steps
     - RPM better but still low: 231-391 RPM
     - Still not reaching target 1050+ RPM

PROBLEM DIAGNOSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IAC IS MOVING ✓
BUT ENGINE NOT RESPONDING ✗

This means: AIR is not changing when IAC moves!

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:

Your observation: "i can see on the gauge the steps but i can't feel any 
                   difference on the engine running"

This is NOT a stuck IAC problem.
This is an AIR FLOW problem.

MOST LIKELY CAUSES (in order of probability):

1. ❌ IAC BYPASS AIR PASSAGE BLOCKED
   - Carbon buildup in IAC air passage
   - Passage too small for this IAC pintle diameter
   - Passage design mismatch (wrong throttle body for this IAC)

2. ❌ IAC INSTALLED IN WRONG PORT
   - IAC might be in vacuum port instead of idle air bypass
   - Check: IAC should control AIR into manifold, not just vacuum signal

3. ❌ VACUUM LEAK bypassing IAC control
   - Large vacuum leak elsewhere lets engine idle independent of IAC
   - IAC changes airflow but leak dominates total air

4. ❌ THROTTLE PLATE POSITION
   - Base idle screw opened too much
   - Engine getting enough air past throttle plate
   - IAC changes don't matter because throttle already open

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SCIENTIFIC PROOF: WHY THIS IS NOT "TOO MUCH FUEL"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You suggested: "could be too much fuel because it's cold"

EVIDENCE AGAINST:
- AFR readings: 13.86-14.54:1 (near stoichiometric, NOT rich)
- If too much fuel, AFR would be < 12.0:1
- Cold enrichment is working correctly (AFR slightly rich, not flooded)

EVIDENCE FOR AIR PROBLEM:
- RPM massively below target (-659 to -983 RPM error)
- IAC moving 90-159 steps but zero RPM response
- Correlation between IAC and RPM near zero (0.179-0.237)
- With resistor, IAC weakened → RPM drops further (75 RPM)

PHYSICS:
- Engine speed controlled by AIR (with fuel following)
- If IAC opens but RPM doesn't rise → AIR not increasing
- If IAC closes but RPM doesn't fall → AIR not decreasing

CONCLUSION: IAC pintle moving, but airflow NOT changing.

BALLAST RESISTOR EFFECT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

COMPARISON: WITH vs WITHOUT 6.8Ω resistor

WITHOUT resistor (START 2 & 4):
  - Current: ~10 Amps (DANGEROUS to Speeduino!)
  - IAC stronger: 159 steps full range
  - RPM: 231-391 RPM (low but better)

WITH resistor (START 3):
  - Current: 1.71 Amps (SAFE for Speeduino) ✓
  - IAC weaker: Only 90 steps movement
  - RPM: 75 RPM (almost stalled)
  - RPM-IAC correlation: 0.179 (worse than without)

INTERPRETATION:
Resistor reduces IAC force → pintle moves less → even LESS airflow change

This PROVES the problem is mechanical/airflow, not electrical.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
DIAGNOSTIC TESTS TO PERFORM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TEST 1: IAC AIR PASSAGE CHECK
  1. Remove IAC from throttle body
  2. Look into IAC bore with flashlight
  3. Check for carbon buildup restricting passage
  4. Measure bore diameter (should be ~8-10mm)
  5. Spray carb cleaner through passage - does it flow freely?

TEST 2: IAC PINTLE vs BORE CLEARANCE
  1. With IAC removed, set to step 0 (fully retracted)
  2. Install in throttle body
  3. Measure gap between pintle tip and bottom of bore
  4. Should have 8-10mm depth available for pintle extension
  5. If pintle bottoms out quickly, bore is too shallow

TEST 3: VACUUM LEAK CHECK
  1. Engine running (somehow get it to idle)
  2. Spray carb cleaner around vacuum hoses, gaskets
  3. If RPM changes → leak found
  4. Also check: brake booster, PCV, any T-fittings

TEST 4: THROTTLE PLATE BASE POSITION
  1. Engine off, key on
  2. Command IAC to step 0 (fully closed)
  3. Look at throttle plate - should be BARELY cracked open
  4. If throttle plate visibly open → base idle screw too far out
  5. Close base idle screw until throttle barely cracked

TEST 5: AIRFLOW MEASUREMENT
  1. Engine idling (somehow)
  2. Command IAC from 0 → 165 steps manually
  3. Put hand near IAC port - do you feel AIR FLOW changing?
  4. If no air movement felt → passage blocked or wrong port

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MOST LIKELY SCENARIO
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Based on all evidence:

IAC BYPASS AIR PASSAGE IS TOO SMALL OR BLOCKED

Why:
1. IAC motor moves normally when removed (you confirmed)
2. IAC motor moves normally when installed (log data confirms)
3. IAC position changes don't affect RPM (correlation ~0.2)
4. Weakening IAC with resistor makes problem WORSE
5. Your observation: "can see steps but can't feel difference"

The IAC pintle is moving in/out, but the AIR PASSAGE is:
  - Too narrow for meaningful airflow change
  - Blocked by carbon
  - Wrong design for this IAC type
  - Connected to wrong port (vacuum instead of air bypass)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOLUTION PATH
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

IMMEDIATE:
1. Inspect IAC air passage for blockage/carbon
2. Clean throttle body thoroughly (especially IAC bore)
3. Verify IAC installed in IDLE AIR port, not vacuum port
4. Check throttle plate base position (should be barely open)

SHORT TERM:
1. Keep ballast resistor installed (protects Speeduino) ✓
2. Increase Injector Opening Time by +0.6ms to compensate
3. Fix IAC airflow issue before tuning further

LONG TERM:
1. If passage too small, consider different IAC with smaller pintle
2. If wrong port, relocate IAC to proper idle air bypass
3. Once IAC controlling RPM properly, re-tune idle settings

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CRITICAL FINDING: POSITIVE RPM-IAC CORRELATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Normal IAC behavior: Correlation should be NEGATIVE (-0.5 to -0.8)
  - IAC closes (higher step count) → airflow reduces → RPM drops
  - IAC opens (lower step count) → airflow increases → RPM rises

Your logs show POSITIVE correlation (0.179 to 0.909):
  - IAC closes → RPM RISES?!
  - IAC opens → RPM DROPS?!

This is BACKWARDS from expected behavior!

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:
1. IAC inverted setting is WRONG (should be "not inverted")
2. IAC controlling vacuum signal, not airflow
3. Secondary effect: IAC closes → manifold vacuum changes → 
   distributor vacuum advance changes → timing changes → RPM changes

RECOMMENDATION:
Check IAC inverted setting in TunerStudio:
  - If "Inverted" → try "Not Inverted"
  - If "Not Inverted" → try "Inverted"
  
Correct behavior: IAC step 0 = maximum airflow, step 165 = minimum airflow
Wrong behavior: IAC step 0 = minimum airflow, step 165 = maximum airflow
