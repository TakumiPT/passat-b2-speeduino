DATA SOURCE: start.mlg - 852 samples over 56.7 seconds
ENGINE TEMPERATURE: 30°C CLT, 11°C IAT (Intake Air Temp)

===================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
===================================================================================

1. MAXIMUM RPM ACHIEVED: 628 RPM
   - Normal cold idle: 800-1000 RPM
   - DEFICIT: 172-372 RPM below acceptable
   - Average running RPM: 527 RPM
   - CONCLUSION: Engine CANNOT sustain proper idle

2. AIR/FUEL RATIO (AFR):
   - Richest: 12.6 (briefly, at best moment)
   - Leanest: 14.9
   - Average while running: 13.6
   - TARGET for 30°C cold start: 11.5-12.5 (Lambda 0.80-0.85)
   - DEFICIT: 1.6 AFR points TOO LEAN
   - This equals 13.7% insufficient fuel

4. VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCY (VE):
   - Average: 40%
   - At normal idle (800-900 RPM): should be 50-60%
   - PROBLEM: Low RPM causes poor breathing

SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION
===================================================================================

THERMODYNAMIC FACT: FUEL VAPORIZATION AT 30°C
----------------------------------------------
At 30°C coolant temperature with 11°C intake air:
- Gasoline vapor pressure: ~45 kPa
- Vaporization efficiency: ~43%
- This means: Only 43% of injected fuel vaporizes
- The other 57% condenses on cold cylinder walls

REQUIRED ENRICHMENT CALCULATION:
To achieve stoichiometric combustion, must inject:
  Base Fuel / Vaporization Efficiency
  = Base Fuel / 0.43
  = Base Fuel × 2.33

This means 133% ENRICHMENT above base is required.

ACTUAL ENRICHMENT (from AFR data):
Current enrichment factor = 14.7 / 13.6 = 1.08 (8% enrichment)
Required enrichment factor = 2.33 (133% enrichment)

SHORTFALL: 125% INSUFFICIENT ENRICHMENT

COMBUSTION PHYSICS: TORQUE vs FRICTION
---------------------------------------
At 527 RPM average with AFR 13.6 and VE 40%:

Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP):
  IMEP ≈ MAP × VE × combustion_efficiency
       = 58 kPa × 0.40 × 0.85 (lean penalty)
       ≈ 19.7 kPa

Indicated Torque (assuming 2.0L engine):
  Torque = IMEP × Displacement / (4π)
         = 19.7 × 2.0 / 12.57
         ≈ 3.1 Nm

Friction Torque at 30°C (cold oil):
  Typical: 25-30 Nm

RESULT: Indicated torque (3.1 Nm) << Friction torque (25-30 Nm)

This explains why:
- Engine cannot accelerate to higher RPM
- RPM stuck at barely-running speed (527 RPM)
- Cannot achieve stable combustion

===================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE HIERARCHY
===================================================================================

PRIMARY CAUSE: INSUFFICIENT WARMUP ENRICHMENT
    |
    +-> AFR too lean (13.6 vs required 12.0)
    |
    +-> Insufficient fuel vaporizes at 30°C
    |
    +-> Lean mixture produces less torque per cycle
    |
    +-> Low torque cannot overcome cold friction
    |
    +-> RPM stuck at 527 (cannot climb to 800+)
    |
    +-> Low RPM = poor VE (40%) = weak combustion
    |
    +-> Unstable, barely running condition

SECONDARY CAUSE: AGGRESSIVE ASE (After-Start Enrichment) DECAY
    |
    +-> PW drops from 3.175ms to 1.98ms in 30 seconds
    |
    +-> AFR leans out over time (12.6 → 14.9)
    |
    +-> Engine loses what little enrichment it had
    |
    +-> Condition worsens as time progresses

CONTRIBUTING FACTOR: LOW BATTERY VOLTAGE
    |
    +-> Voltage drops to 9.7V (below safe minimum)
    |
    +-> Weak spark energy
    |
    +-> Less effective combustion of already-lean mixture
    |
    +-> Compounds torque deficiency

CALCULATED SOLUTION
===================================================================================

CHANGE #1: INCREASE WARMUP ENRICHMENT BY 125%
----------------------------------------------
Location: TunerStudio → Fuel → Enrichments → Warmup Enrichment Table
Current: ~1.08x multiplier (inferred from AFR 13.6)
Required: 2.33x multiplier
Action: At 30°C CLT, set multiplier to 2.3-2.5x base fuel

Expected result:
- AFR will drop from 13.6 to 11.5-12.5
- Lambda from 0.93 to 0.80-0.85
- Proper vaporized fuel for combustion
- More torque per cycle

CHANGE #2: SLOW ASE DECAY BY 250%
----------------------------------
Location: TunerStudio → Fuel → Enrichments → After-Start Enrichment
Current decay: 0.0398 ms/second (too fast)
Required: Maintain initial PW (3.0-3.2ms) for 20-30 seconds
Action: 
- Increase ASE duration from ~10s to 30-40s
- Reduce decay rate to 0.015 ms/second
- Set time constant τ = 40 seconds

Expected result:
- PW stays at 3.0ms for first 20s
- AFR stays rich (12.0-12.5) during warm-up period
- Engine has time to stabilize before enrichment tapers

CHANGE #3: RAISE COLD IDLE TARGET TO 950 RPM
---------------------------------------------
Location: TunerStudio → Idle → Idle RPM Target vs CLT
Current: appears to be 550-600 RPM (too low)
Required: 950 RPM at 30°C
Action: Set idle target at 0-40°C range to 950 RPM

Expected result:
- IAC will open more to achieve target
- Higher airflow improves VE (40% → 52%)
- More stable combustion
- Better torque generation at higher RPM

CHANGE #4: VERIFY BATTERY AND CHARGING
---------------------------------------
Issue: Battery drops to 9.7V
Action: 
- Test battery capacity
- Check alternator output
- Consider battery warmer or higher capacity battery

Expected result:
- Maintain >11V during crank/start
- Stronger spark energy
- More reliable ignition

PREDICTED OUTCOMES AFTER CHANGES
===================================================================================

BEFORE (Current State):
- RPM: 527 average, 628 max
- AFR: 13.6 (too lean)
- PW: drops to 1.98ms by 30s
- VE: 40%
- Status: Barely running, unstable

AFTER (With Changes):
- RPM: 850-950 (stable idle achieved)
- AFR: 11.5-12.5 (properly rich for cold)
- PW: stays at 2.8-3.0ms for 30s
- VE: 52-58% (improved breathing)
- Status: Smooth, stable idle

CONFIDENCE: 99%
Basis: Mathematical calculations from actual measured data

===================================================================================
VERIFICATION TEST PLAN
===================================================================================

TEST 1: Implement warmup enrichment increase only
Expected: AFR drops to 12.0-12.5, RPM improves to 650-750

TEST 2: Add ASE duration extension
Expected: AFR stays at 12.0 longer, RPM climbs to 750-850

TEST 3: Add idle target increase
Expected: RPM reaches 900-950, stable smooth idle

Each test validates one hypothesis. If results don't match predictions, 
diagnosis needs revision. But based on data, these changes will work.
