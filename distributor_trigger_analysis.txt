VW PASSAT B2 1984 ENGINE CODE DT DISTRIBUTOR ANALYSIS
======================================================

DISTRIBUTOR TYPE:
-----------------
VW Passat B2 (1981-1988) with 1.6L DT engine used:
- Bosch Hall Effect distributor
- Part numbers: 027 905 205 series (various suffixes)
- 3-wire Hall sensor (Ground, +12V, Signal)

HALL SENSOR OPERATION:
----------------------
VW/Bosch Hall sensors work as follows:
1. Rotor has windows (open) and shutters (closed)
2. Hall sensor detects magnetic field through windows
3. Signal output:
   - Window passes: Hall sensor ON (typically +5V or +12V)
   - Shutter blocks: Hall sensor OFF (0V)

TRIGGER EDGE:
-------------
For VW Hall distributors, the critical question is:
- Does timing point occur when signal goes HIGH (rising edge)?
- Or when signal goes LOW (falling edge)?

STANDARD VW BOSCH HALL SENSOR BEHAVIOR:
For most VW Bosch distributors (including Passat B2):
- Trigger occurs when SHUTTER EDGE enters Hall sensor gap
- This causes signal to go from HIGH to LOW
- Therefore: FALLING EDGE trigger

VERIFICATION FROM YOUR TUNE:
-----------------------------
CurrentTune.msq shows: TrigEdge = "FALLING"

This matches standard VW Bosch Hall sensor behavior!

CONFIRMATION:
-------------
✓ FALLING edge is CORRECT for VW Passat B2 distributor
✓ This is standard for VW Hall effect distributors
✓ Your current tune already has this set correctly

If you had RISING edge:
- RPM reading might work (counts pulses regardless)
- But ignition timing would be 180° off (fires on wrong stroke!)
- Engine would backfire severely or not run at all

YOUR SETTING IS CORRECT: FALLING
