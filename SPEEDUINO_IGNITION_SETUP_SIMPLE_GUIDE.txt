SPEEDUINO IGNITION SETUP - SIMPLE GUIDE FOR VW DT ENGINE
========================================================================

YOUR ENGINE: VW 1.6L DT with DISTRIBUTOR (mechanical advance disconnected)
GOAL: Make Speeduino control ignition timing instead of distributor

========================================================================
CURRENT STATUS (what you have now):
========================================================================

✓ Fuel control: WORKING (Speeduino controls injector)
✗ Ignition control: NOT WORKING (distributor still controls timing)

Your current settings:
- Trigger Pattern: "Basic Distributor" ✓ CORRECT
- Spark Mode: "Wasted Spark" ✗ WRONG (should be "Single Channel")

========================================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO - 3 SIMPLE STEPS:
========================================================================

STEP 1: CHANGE SPARK MODE IN TUNERSTUDIO
=========================================

1. Open TunerStudio
2. Go to: **Spark Settings** tab
3. Find: "Spark Output Mode"
4. Change from: "Wasted Spark"
5. Change to: **"Single Channel"**

WHY?
- Your engine has a DISTRIBUTOR (one coil)
- Single Channel = all spark signals go to IGN1 output
- Distributor then distributes spark to each cylinder
- This is the correct mode for distributor engines

------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 2: WIRE SPEEDUINO IGN1 TO IGNITION MODULE
===============================================

CURRENT WIRING (distributor controls timing):
----------------------------------------------
Distributor signal → Ignition module → Coil

NEW WIRING (Speeduino controls timing):
----------------------------------------
Speeduino IGN1 → Ignition module → Coil

PHYSICAL STEPS:

a) LOCATE THE WIRES:
   - Speeduino board: Find "IGN1" output pin
   - Ignition module: Find signal input wire (usually from distributor)

b) DISCONNECT OLD SIGNAL:
   - Unplug wire from distributor to ignition module
   - This wire was telling module WHEN to fire
   - We want Speeduino to control this now

c) CONNECT SPEEDUINO:
   - Wire from Speeduino IGN1 → Ignition module signal input
   - Use same connection point where distributor signal was
   - Make sure ground is common (Speeduino GND = Engine GND)

d) TAPE UP OLD DISTRIBUTOR WIRE:
   - The disconnected distributor signal wire
   - Insulate it so it doesn't short
   - You might reconnect it later if testing

IMPORTANT - DISTRIBUTOR STILL NEEDED!
--------------------------------------
✓ Distributor MECHANICAL PART stays connected
✓ It still DISTRIBUTES spark to each cylinder
✓ Only the TIMING SIGNAL is now from Speeduino
✗ Do NOT remove distributor from engine!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 3: SET TRIGGER ANGLE WITH TIMING LIGHT
============================================

This is CRITICAL - tells Speeduino where piston #1 is!

WHAT YOU NEED:
--------------
- Timing light (strobe light for timing)
- Socket wrench to rotate engine
- Helper (makes it easier)

PROCEDURE:

a) PREPARE ENGINE:
   1. Mark the timing marks on crankshaft pulley
   2. Factory mark should be at 18° BTDC for idle
   3. Make sure you can see timing marks clearly

b) IN TUNERSTUDIO - FIX TIMING TO 18°:
   1. Go to: Spark Settings
   2. Find: "Fixed Angle"
   3. Set to: **18** (degrees)
   4. This locks timing to 18° for testing
   5. Burn to ECU

c) START ENGINE (will run on fixed 18° timing):
   1. Start engine and let it idle
   2. Timing is now locked at 18° BTDC
   3. Should idle relatively normally

d) USE TIMING LIGHT:
   1. Connect timing light to cylinder #1 spark plug wire
   2. Point light at timing marks on crankshaft pulley
   3. Engine running, you'll see timing mark "frozen" by strobe

e) READ THE TIMING MARK:
   Question: Does the timing mark show 18° BTDC?
   
   **IF YES (mark at 18°):**
   → Your Trigger Angle is correct! (probably 0° or factory setting)
   → Skip to Step f)
   
   **IF NO (mark shows different angle, e.g., 10° or 25°):**
   → You need to adjust "Trigger Angle" in TunerStudio
   
   Example:
   - Speeduino set to 18°
   - Timing light shows 25°
   - Difference = 25 - 18 = 7° too advanced
   - New Trigger Angle = Current + 7°
   
   Or:
   - Speeduino set to 18°
   - Timing light shows 10°
   - Difference = 18 - 10 = 8° too retarded
   - New Trigger Angle = Current - 8°

f) ADJUST TRIGGER ANGLE (if needed):
   1. Stop engine
   2. In TunerStudio → Trigger Setup
   3. Find: "Trigger Angle"
   4. Adjust by the difference you measured
   5. Burn to ECU
   6. Restart engine
   7. Check timing light again
   8. Repeat until timing mark shows exactly 18°

g) REMOVE FIXED TIMING:
   1. Once timing light shows perfect 18°
   2. Go to: Spark Settings → Fixed Angle
   3. Change from: 18
   4. Change to: **0** (normal operation)
   5. Burn to ECU
   6. Now Speeduino controls timing from the advance table!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 4: TEST DRIVE AND VERIFY
==============================

a) IDLE TEST:
   - Engine should idle at ~18° (your ignition table setting)
   - Use timing light to verify
   - Should be smooth, no difference from before

b) REV TEST:
   - Gently rev engine to 2000 RPM
   - Timing should advance to ~32-34° (from your table)
   - Timing light will show this
   - Should rev smoothly

c) ROAD TEST:
   - Drive gently at first
   - No pinging/knocking sound (if you hear pinging, reduce timing!)
   - Should feel normal power
   - Monitor for any misfires

========================================================================
SAFETY CHECKS:
========================================================================

BEFORE STARTING ENGINE FIRST TIME:
-----------------------------------
1. ✓ Spark mode set to "Single Channel"
2. ✓ Fixed angle set to 18° for initial test
3. ✓ IGN1 wired to ignition module
4. ✓ Distributor still mechanically connected
5. ✓ All grounds are common (Speeduino GND = Engine GND)

IF ENGINE WON'T START:
-----------------------
1. Check spark with timing light - is there spark?
2. If NO spark:
   - Check IGN1 connection
   - Check ignition module ground
   - Check Speeduino power
3. If YES spark but won't start:
   - Trigger angle might be WAY off
   - Try adjusting ±20° in trigger angle
   - Check trigger pattern is correct

IF ENGINE RUNS BUT POORLY:
---------------------------
1. Rough idle:
   - Timing might be off
   - Adjust trigger angle
   - Use timing light to verify

2. No power / hesitation:
   - Check ignition advance table values
   - Make sure Fixed Angle is set to 0 (not locked)

3. Pinging/knocking:
   - STOP ENGINE immediately
   - Reduce timing in advance table by 2-4°
   - Your 95 RON fuel should handle 18° idle, 40° max

========================================================================
TUNERSTUDIO SETTINGS SUMMARY:
========================================================================

TRIGGER SETUP TAB:
------------------
Trigger Pattern: "Basic Distributor" (already correct)
Trigger Angle: 0° (adjust with timing light later)
Skip Revolutions: 1 or 2
Trigger Edge: RISING (or as currently set)

SPARK SETTINGS TAB:
-------------------
Spark Output Mode: **"Single Channel"** ← CHANGE THIS!
Cranking Advance: 12° BTDC
Fixed Angle: 18° (for setup), then 0° (for normal use)
Spark Output Triggers: "GOING LOW" (most common)

ADVANCE TABLE (already good):
------------------------------
Idle (600-1000 RPM, low load): 18°
Cruise (2000-3000 RPM, medium load): 30-34°
WOT (high load): 32-40°

========================================================================
SIMPLE TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================================================

PROBLEM: No spark at all
FIX: 
  - Check IGN1 connection
  - Verify ignition module has power
  - Check ground connections

PROBLEM: Engine starts but runs rough
FIX:
  - Adjust trigger angle with timing light
  - Make sure Fixed Angle = 0 for normal running

PROBLEM: Pinging/knocking sound
FIX:
  - STOP engine immediately
  - Reduce timing by 2-4° in advance table
  - Use lower octane timing values

PROBLEM: Engine won't rev past 3000 RPM
FIX:
  - Check advance table has proper values
  - Make sure Fixed Angle = 0

PROBLEM: Timing light shows wrong angle
FIX:
  - Adjust "Trigger Angle" in Trigger Setup
  - Add degrees if timing is too retarded
  - Subtract degrees if timing is too advanced

========================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER SETUP:
========================================================================

BEFORE (distributor controlled):
---------------------------------
- Timing advances mechanically with RPM
- Vacuum advance affects timing
- Cannot tune timing electronically
- Fixed advance curve

AFTER (Speeduino controlled):
------------------------------
✓ Timing controlled by advance table
✓ Can adjust timing for any RPM/load point
✓ Optimized timing for 95 RON fuel
✓ Better fuel economy
✓ Better power
✓ Can log actual timing advance
✓ Safety features (knock detection possible)

========================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES:
========================================================================

1. DISTRIBUTOR IS STILL NEEDED:
   - It distributes spark to correct cylinder
   - Only TIMING is now electronic
   - Do NOT remove distributor!

2. VACUUM ADVANCE DISABLED:
   - Disconnect vacuum line to distributor
   - Speeduino handles load-based timing
   - Plug vacuum port with bolt/cap

3. MECHANICAL ADVANCE LOCKED:
   - Remove mechanical advance springs if possible
   - Or lock distributor at minimum advance
   - Prevents fighting with Speeduino timing

4. START WITH CONSERVATIVE TIMING:
   - Your current table is good (18-40°)
   - Don't exceed 40° until you've tested
   - Listen for any pinging/knocking

5. TIMING LIGHT IS MANDATORY:
   - Cannot set up without timing light
   - Need to verify trigger angle
   - Borrow one if you don't have

========================================================================
WHAT TO EXPECT DURING FIRST START:
========================================================================

FIRST ATTEMPT (Fixed timing at 18°):
------------------------------------
- Should start normally (maybe slightly harder)
- Will idle at fixed 18° timing
- Won't rev smoothly (timing doesn't advance)
- THIS IS NORMAL - it's for calibration only

AFTER TRIGGER ANGLE SET CORRECTLY:
-----------------------------------
- Set Fixed Angle back to 0
- Engine uses advance table
- Should start normally
- Idles smoothly at 18°
- Revs cleanly with advancing timing
- Ready for road test

DURING ROAD TEST:
------------------
- Acceleration should feel normal or better
- No pinging (if you hear pinging, reduce timing!)
- Timing advances smoothly with RPM/load
- Can log actual timing in TunerStudio

========================================================================
FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE FIRST START:
========================================================================

TUNERSTUDIO:
□ Spark Mode = "Single Channel"
□ Fixed Angle = 18° (for first test)
□ Cranking Advance = 12°
□ Advance table has reasonable values (18-40°)
□ Burn settings to ECU

WIRING:
□ Speeduino IGN1 connected to ignition module signal
□ Old distributor signal wire disconnected and insulated
□ Distributor still mechanically connected
□ All grounds common

MECHANICAL:
□ Vacuum advance disconnected
□ Mechanical advance locked (if possible)
□ Timing marks visible on crankshaft pulley
□ Timing light ready

SAFETY:
□ Fire extinguisher nearby (just in case!)
□ Helper available
□ Clear area around engine
□ Battery fully charged

========================================================================
QUESTIONS TO ASK IF YOU GET STUCK:
========================================================================

1. "Does the timing light show spark?"
   → If NO: Wiring problem
   → If YES: Timing calibration needed

2. "What angle does the timing light show?"
   → Compare to Fixed Angle setting
   → Adjust Trigger Angle to match

3. "Does engine run better at different Fixed Angle?"
   → Try 15°, 18°, 20° to find best idle
   → This helps find correct base timing

4. "Can you log ignition advance in TunerStudio?"
   → If YES: Speeduino is controlling timing ✓
   → If NO: Check Spark Mode setting

========================================================================
YOU GOT THIS! TAKE IT STEP BY STEP!
========================================================================

The hardest part is setting the Trigger Angle with timing light.
Everything else is just following the steps above.

Good luck! Report back what happens when you test!
