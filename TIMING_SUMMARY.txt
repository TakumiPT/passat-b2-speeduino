TIMING ANALYSIS - WHEN DO EVENTS HAPPEN?
================================================================================

YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED:
========================

1. WHEN DOES PW DROP FROM 3.175ms TO 1.98ms? (38% decay)
   --------------------------------------------------------
   Looking at the running portion (after engine starts):
   
   - Engine starts at: t=10.7s
   - Initial running PW: ~3.2ms
   - PW at t=38.2s: 1.98ms
   - Time to decay: 27.5 seconds after start
   
   WHY: After-Start Enrichment (ASE) decays too quickly
        ECU is programmed to reduce fuel progressively
        Should hold enrichment longer at 30°C
   
   TIMELINE:
   t=10.7s: Start, PW ~3.2ms, AFR ~12.6 (acceptable)
   t=20.7s: PW ~2.5ms, AFR ~13.5 (getting lean)
   t=30.7s: PW ~2.1ms, AFR ~13.8 (too lean)
   t=38.2s: PW ~1.98ms, AFR ~14.0 (very lean)

2. WHEN DOES BATTERY DROP TO 9.7V?
   ---------------------------------
   - Minimum battery: 9.7V occurs at t=48.6s
   - This is DURING cranking for restart attempt!
   - The log shows: RPM=145, engine barely turning
   
   IMPORTANT FINDING:
   - Initial start at t=10.7s: Battery 10.4V (marginal)
   - During running: Battery 10.8V average (weak)
   - During second crank: Battery drops to 9.7V (critical)
   
   WHAT THIS MEANS:
   Your battery is WEAK (should be 12-13V healthy)
   9.7V during cranking = battery struggling
   10.4V even at start = battery already low
   
   HOWEVER: Battery weakness is NOT causing the lean condition
            It may make cranking harder, but doesn't affect AFR

3. IS MAP NORMAL FOR THAT RPM?
   ----------------------------
   YES! MAP is perfectly normal.
   
   At 527 RPM running:
   - MAP: 60 kPa average (range: 54-72 kPa)
   - Expected: 45-65 kPa for closed throttle idle
   - Vacuum created: 41 kPa below atmosphere (101-60=41)
   
   WHY MAP IS GOOD:
   - Engine creating proper vacuum (pulling air through IAC)
   - No intake leaks (would show MAP >70 kPa)
   - No restrictions (would show MAP <45 kPa)
   - Manifold pressure appropriate for RPM
   
   For comparison:
   - 800 RPM normal idle: MAP typically 55-60 kPa
   - 500 RPM struggling: MAP typically 58-62 kPa
   - Your 527 RPM at 60 kPa: EXACTLY as expected
   
   CONCLUSION: MAP sensor working correctly, no vacuum leaks

4. WHAT ABOUT IAC?
   ----------------
   IAC is also NORMAL, but cannot compensate for lean mixture.
   
   IAC Statistics:
   - Average position: 88 steps (while running)
   - At start: 174 steps (wide open for cold start)
   - During running: 80-84 steps (stabilized)
   - Typical range: 80-120 steps for cold idle
   
   IAC BEHAVIOR:
   - Opens to 174 steps at start (correct - needs air)
   - Settles to 80-88 steps while running (normal)
   - Trying to add air to increase RPM
   
   WHY IAC CANNOT FIX THE PROBLEM:
   
   IAC adds AIR, not FUEL.
   
   Current AFR: 13.6:1 (too lean)
   IAC opens more -> More AIR enters
   More air + same fuel = LEANER AFR (14:1, 15:1...)
   Leaner AFR = LESS power
   Less power = RPM cannot increase
   
   Think of it this way:
   - You need gasoline:air ratio of 12:1 (12 parts air, 1 part fuel)
   - You only have 13.6:1 (too much air, not enough fuel)
   - IAC opens: Now you have 15:1 (even worse!)
   - IAC cannot add fuel, only air
   - Solution: Add MORE FUEL first, then IAC can control RPM

COMPLETE EVENT TIMELINE
================================================================================

t=0s to 10.7s: PRE-START / CRANKING
----------------------------------
Battery: Starts at ~11-12V, drops during crank
RPM: 0 (cranking but not yet running)
PW: Cranking pulsewidth (enriched)
MAP: Atmospheric (97 kPa)
IAC: Opening to cold start position

t=10.7s: ENGINE FIRES AND STARTS
---------------------------------
RPM: Jumps to 534 RPM

PW: Minimum running value 1.98ms
Battery: Still weak
MAP: Rises toward atmospheric (engine losing power)
IAC: Opens to 180 steps (desperation mode)

------------------------------------------
RPM: 145 (barely cranking)
Battery: Drops to 9.7V (critical low)
MAP: 72 kPa (engine not pulling vacuum)
This is where you try to restart after stall

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE HIERARCHY
================================================================================

PRIMARY PROBLEM: INSUFFICIENT FUEL ENRICHMENT
   ↓
   Fuel decays from 3.2ms to 1.98ms in 27 seconds
   ↓
   AFR becomes too lean (13.6:1 instead of 12:1)
   ↓
   Lean mixture = Less power produced
   ↓
   RPM stuck at 527, cannot overcome friction
   ↓
   Engine eventually stalls

SECONDARY ISSUE: WEAK BATTERY
   Battery at 10.4V during start (should be 12-13V)
   Battery at 9.7V during restart (critically low)
   ↓
   Makes cranking harder
   May affect ignition spark energy
   BUT: Not causing the lean AFR problem

NOT PROBLEMS:
   ✓ MAP: 60 kPa is correct for 527 RPM
   ✓ IAC: 88 steps is normal range
   ✓ No vacuum leaks
   ✓ No intake restrictions
   ✓ Engine mechanically sound (creates proper vacuum)

================================================================================
TECHNICAL EXPLANATION: WHY MAP AND IAC ARE NORMAL
================================================================================

MAP (Manifold Absolute Pressure):
---------------------------------
MAP measures pressure in intake manifold.

Atmospheric pressure: 101 kPa (sea level)
Your MAP while running: 60 kPa
Vacuum created: 101 - 60 = 41 kPa

What creates vacuum?
- Pistons moving down suck air through throttle/IAC
- At idle, throttle closed, only IAC allows air
- Engine acts like air pump, creating negative pressure

Why 60 kPa is normal at 527 RPM:
- At low RPM, pistons move slowly
- Less air sucked per minute
- IAC at 88 steps provides some airflow
- Balance: Air pulled in = Air entering through IAC
- Result: Moderate vacuum (60 kPa)

If MAP was WRONG:
- MAP >70 kPa = Vacuum leak (too much air entering)
- MAP <50 kPa = Restricted intake (not enough air)
- Your 60 kPa = Goldilocks zone (just right)

IAC (Idle Air Control):
-----------------------
IAC is a stepper motor that opens/closes air bypass around throttle.

Your IAC behavior:
- Cold start: Opens to 174 steps (needs lots of air for combustion)
- Stabilizes: Closes to 80-88 steps (less air needed as warmup)
- When struggling: Opens to try increasing RPM

Why IAC cannot fix lean condition:

Scenario without enough fuel:
    Current state: 13.6 parts air : 1 part fuel (too lean)
    IAC opens more: 15 parts air : 1 part fuel (even leaner!)
    Result: WORSE, not better
    
Scenario with proper fuel:
    Fixed state: 12 parts air : 1 part fuel (correct)
    RPM too low: IAC opens, adds more air
    ECU adds more fuel to match: Still 12:1 ratio maintained
    More air + more fuel = More power = RPM increases
    Result: IAC can now control RPM effectively

The key: IAC works WITH fuel enrichment, not instead of it.

FINAL ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: When does PW drop 38% (3.175ms → 1.98ms)?
A: Over 27.5 seconds after start (t=10.7s to t=38.2s)
   This is the After-Start Enrichment decaying too fast

Q: When does battery drop to 9.7V?
A: At t=48.6s during restart attempt after engine nearly stalled
   Battery is weak throughout (10.4V at start, should be 12-13V)

Q: Is MAP normal for that RPM?
A: YES - 60 kPa at 527 RPM is perfect
   Shows proper vacuum, no leaks, no restrictions

Q: Is IAC normal?
A: YES - 88 steps is normal range for cold idle
   BUT: Cannot compensate for lean mixture (adds air, not fuel)
   IAC will work properly once fuel enrichment is fixed

================================================================================
ACTION PLAN
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE FIX:
1. Increase warmup enrichment at 30°C from 1.08x to 2.3x (+125%)
2. Extend After-Start Enrichment duration from ~10s to 30-40s
3. Slow ASE decay rate so fuel stays at 2.8-3.0ms longer

SECONDARY FIX:
4. Charge or replace battery (10.4V is too low for reliable starting)
5. Test with battery at 12.5V+ for best results

VERIFICATION:
- AFR should stabilize at 12.0-12.5:1 (not 13.6:1)
- RPM should climb to 850-950 (not 527)
- PW should hold at 2.8-3.0ms for 30+ seconds (not decay to 1.98ms)
- Battery voltage will be more stable with less cranking stress

MAP and IAC will work correctly once fuel is fixed!
