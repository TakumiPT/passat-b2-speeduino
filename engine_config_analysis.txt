ENGINE CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS - CORRECTED
==========================================

ACTUAL VEHICLE & ENGINE:
------------------------
Vehicle: VW Passat B2 (1984)
Engine Code: DT
Displacement: 1.6L (1595cc)
Power: 75 PS (55 kW / ~74 HP)
Engine Family: EA827
Original Fuel System: Pierburg 2E2 carburetor (dual-throat downdraft)
Compression Ratio: 9.0:1
Valve Configuration: OHC (overhead cam), 8-valve

CONVERSION PROJECT:
-------------------
REMOVED: Pierburg 2E2 carburetor
INSTALLED: Gol G2 SPI monopoint throttle body (Brazilian VW part)
           - Single injector before throttle butterfly
           - Throttle position sensor
           - Idle air control valve
CONTROLLER: Speeduino v4 (fuel + ignition control)
IGNITION: Bosch Module 124 (ignition amplifier)
          Original distributor (Hall sensor signal to Speeduino)

TIMING SPECIFICATIONS (Passat B2 1.6L DT):
------------------------------------------
Factory timing: 18° BTDC at idle
Haynes manual note: "Don't disconnect vacuum to adjust"
  → This was for CARBURETOR setup with mechanical distributor
  → 18° included vacuum advance contribution

For Speeduino setup:
- Disconnect vacuum (Speeduino replaces it)
- Target 18° BTDC total at idle (electronically controlled)
- Cranking: 12° BTDC

MONOPOINT THROTTLE BODY:
------------------------
From: VW Gol G2 (Brazilian market)
Type: Single-point injection (SPI)
Injector location: Before throttle butterfly
Advantages over Pierburg 2E2:
  - Better fuel atomization
  - Electronic fuel control (Speeduino)
  - No carburetor maintenance
  - Better cold start reliability
  - Emission improvements

Similar to: Bosch Mono-Jetronic systems used in 1980s-90s VW

IGNITION TIMING STRATEGY:
--------------------------
DT engine characteristics:
- 9.0:1 compression (moderate)
- Designed for 91 RON fuel (European regular)
- Conservative timing for reliability
- Good low-end torque focus

Recommended timing:
- Cranking: 12° BTDC
- Idle: 18° BTDC (matches factory spec)
- Cruise: 24-32° BTDC
- WOT: 28-35° BTDC (conservative for pump gas)

SPEEDUINO v4 SETUP:
-------------------
Board version: Speeduino v4.x
Firmware: 2025.01.6 (already installed)
Current mode: Fuel-only (ignition independent)
Target mode: Fuel + Ignition control

Required changes:
1. Enable ignition bypass
2. Configure advance table (18° at idle)
3. Set cranking timing (12° BTDC)
4. Calibrate trigger angle with timing light
5. Disconnect vacuum advance physically

This replicates factory Bosch Mono-Jetronic functionality!
