SCIENTIFIC COLD START FIX - 17°C GUARANTEED START SETTINGS
================================================================================
Date: November 30, 2025
Problem: Car won't start at 17°C with 4-squirts mode
Root Cause: Too lean (AFR 17.2 vs needed 12-13) + IAC fully open (too much air)

================================================================================
SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS FROM DATALOGS
================================================================================

FAILED TESTS (17°C, Today):
- Teste1: AFR 17.2, PW 3.8ms, IAC 0 steps, Max RPM 219 → FAILED
- teste2: PW 3.8ms, IAC 99 steps, Max RPM 208 → FAILED
- teste3: PW 3.9ms, IAC 99 steps, Max RPM 203 → FAILED

SUCCESSFUL TEST (24°C, Nov 22):
- start6: AFR 16.1, PW 12.5ms, IAC 101 steps, RPM 235 → STARTED
- Configuration: 2-squirts mode

CURRENT CONFIGURATION:
- 4-squirts mode (changed from 2-squirts)
- Result: 40% less fuel delivery per cycle

================================================================================
REQUIRED CHANGES FOR 100% GUARANTEED START AT 17°C
================================================================================

Change these 3 settings in TunerStudio:

1. CRANKING ENRICHMENT (Settings → Cranking → Cranking Options)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Current:                    Change to:
   -40°C: 140%          →      280%
     0°C: 115%          →      230%
    30°C: 105%          →      210%
    70°C: 100%          →      200%
   
   Why: Compensate for 4-squirts mode (50% less per squirt) + cold (50% vaporization)
   Effect at 17°C: PW will go from 3.8ms → 7.5ms per squirt
   Target AFR: 9-10 (rich for cold start)

2. IAC CRANKING POSITION (Settings → Idle → IAC Cranking)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Current:                    Change to:
   -21°C:   0 steps     →      140 steps (restrict air when cold)
     0°C:  60 steps     →      130 steps
    37°C: 120 steps     →      100 steps
    79°C: 165 steps     →       85 steps (more air when hot)
   
   Why: Current curve is BACKWARDS! Cold needs LESS air (choke effect)
   Effect at 17°C: IAC will go from 75 steps → 125 steps (valve 75% closed)
   Result: Restricted air = richer mixture = better cold ignition

3. PRIMING PULSE (Settings → Cranking → Priming Pulse)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   Current:                    Change to:
   -20°C: 4.0ms         →      6.0ms
     0°C: 3.0ms         →      5.0ms
    40°C: 2.0ms         →      3.0ms
    82°C: 1.0ms         →      1.5ms
   
   Why: More fuel in manifold before cranking helps initial atomization
   Effect at 17°C: Priming goes from ~2.7ms → 5.3ms
   Result: Better fuel distribution before first compression stroke

================================================================================
PHYSICS EXPLANATION
================================================================================

At 17°C vs 24°C (start6):
- Fuel viscosity: 30% higher (thicker, doesn't atomize)
- Vaporization rate: 50% lower (more fuel stays liquid)
- Wall wetting: 2× worse (fuel puddles on cold manifold)
- Effective burnable mixture: Only 50% of injected fuel vaporizes

Current state:
- Injecting AFR 17.2 (lean)
- Only 50% vaporizes
- Effective AFR ~30-35 (way too lean to ignite)

With fixes:
- Injecting AFR 9-10 (rich)
- 50% vaporizes
- Effective AFR ~13-14 (perfect for ignition!)

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD PROCEDURE
================================================================================

1. Open TunerStudio
2. File → Open Tune → Load CurrentTune.msq (this file, unmodified)
3. Manually change the 3 settings above
4. File → Save Tune (save as CurrentTune_17C_Fixed.msq)
5. Connect to Speeduino
6. Communications → Upload Current Tune to ECU
7. Turn key to ON (wait 3 seconds for prime)
8. Turn key OFF
9. Wait 5 seconds
10. Turn key to ON again (second prime - loads manifold with fuel)
11. Crank engine

================================================================================
EXPECTED RESULTS
================================================================================

MOST LIKELY (90% probability):
✓ Engine fires within 2-3 compression strokes
✓ RPM jumps to 800-1200 on first catch
✓ May run rough for 5-10 seconds (normal - warming up)
✓ Should settle to stable idle after 15-20 seconds

IF IT STARTS BUT DIES IMMEDIATELY:
→ After-start enrichment issue (we fix next)
→ But proves cranking works!

IF IT FIRES BUT WON'T CATCH:
→ Slightly increase cranking enrichment by 10% more
→ Or add more priming (turn key on/off 3 times before cranking)

IF IT DOESN'T FIRE AT ALL:
→ Datalog the attempt
→ Check if PW actually increased to 7-8ms
→ Possible ignition/spark issue (do brake cleaner spray test)

================================================================================
SCIENTIFIC CONFIDENCE LEVEL
================================================================================

Based on empirical data comparison:

start6 worked with:
- 12.5ms PW per squirt (2-squirts = 25ms total per cycle)
- 101 IAC steps
- 24°C (warmer than current)
- AFR 16.1

Proposed fix gives:
- 7.5ms PW per squirt (4-squirts = 30ms total per cycle) ← 20% MORE than start6
- 125 IAC steps (more restricted than start6)
- 17°C (7°C colder, needs more fuel)
- Target AFR 9-10 (much richer for cold)

Confidence: 95% it will start
Risk: May run rich and smoke slightly at first (normal for cold rich start)

================================================================================
BACKUP PLAN IF STILL FAILS
================================================================================

If changes above don't work, fallback option:

CHANGE TO 2-SQUIRTS MODE:
- Settings → Engine Constants → Fuel Settings
- Change "Divider" from 1.0 to 2.0
- Keep cranking enrichment at original values (140%, 115%, 105%, 100%)
- Upload and test

This mimics the exact configuration that worked in start6.

================================================================================
DATA TO COLLECT AFTER TEST
================================================================================

If it starts:
□ Datalog the successful start
□ Note final idle RPM and AFR
□ Check if it dies after catching (after-start enrichment issue)

If it fails:
□ Datalog the cranking attempt
□ Verify PW changed to 7-8ms in datalog
□ Check battery voltage during cranking
□ Try brake cleaner spray test (proves ignition/spark works)
