SIMPLE FIX GUIDE - COLD START PROBLEM AT 17°C
================================================================================
Date: December 1, 2025
Problem: Car fires but won't stay running (starts then dies)
         Backfires through intake (too lean mixture)

================================================================================
WHAT'S HAPPENING (SIMPLE EXPLANATION)
================================================================================

Think of your engine like a campfire:

1. LIGHTING THE FIRE (Cranking):
   ✓ You're using LOTS of gasoline (218%) 
   ✓ Engine catches and fires → RPM goes up to 400-500
   ✓ This part WORKS NOW! (teste4 and teste5 proved it)

2. KEEPING IT BURNING (Afterstart - ASE):
   ✗ Gasoline suddenly drops from 218% to only 21%
   ✗ Like removing 90% of wood from your campfire
   ✗ Fire dies immediately (not enough fuel)
   ✗ Backfires happen = too much air, not enough fuel

3. WARMUP (WUE):
   ✗ Never gets here because engine dies in step 2

THE PROBLEM: You're giving the engine a LOT of fuel to start, but then 
IMMEDIATELY taking it away. The engine needs to stay rich for 15-20 seconds 
after it catches!

================================================================================
WHY BACKFIRES HAPPEN (INTAKE MISFIRES)
================================================================================

Your engine has a MONOPOINT injector (one injector before throttle butterfly).

When mixture is TOO LEAN (not enough fuel):
- Some fuel ignites in cylinder ✓
- But mixture is weak and burns SLOW
- Intake valve opens while still burning
- Flame shoots BACK through intake valve
- BOOM! Backfire in intake manifold

This is PROOF the mixture is too lean! Your AFR is 19.7 but needs to be 12-13.

At 17°C (cold engine):
- Only 50% of fuel vaporizes
- Other 50% sticks to walls (waste)
- So you need to inject DOUBLE to get enough vapor
- When ASE drops to 21%, there's not enough vaporized fuel
- Weak mixture → slow burn → backfire

================================================================================
THE FIX - WHAT TO CHANGE IN TUNERSTUDIO
================================================================================

Open TunerStudio → Go to "Afterstart Enrichment (ASE)" table

CHANGE THESE 4 VALUES:

Temperature    OLD VALUE    NEW VALUE    Why?
-----------    ---------    ---------    ----
   -20°C          25%    →    80%       Very cold needs very rich
     0°C          20%    →    70%       Cold needs rich  
    40°C          15%    →    50%       Warm needs moderate
    80°C          10%    →    30%       Hot needs less

KEEP THE TIME VALUES THE SAME:
   -20°C: 25 seconds (don't change)
     0°C: 20 seconds (don't change)
    40°C: 15 seconds (don't change)
    80°C: 6 seconds (don't change)

OPTIONAL (helps smooth transition):
Find "ASE Taper Time" → Change from 1.0 to 2.0 seconds

================================================================================
WHAT THIS DOES (AT YOUR 17°C TEMPERATURE)
================================================================================

BEFORE (current tune):
  Cranking: 218% fuel → engine fires ✓
  ASE:       21% fuel → engine dies ✗ (HUGE DROP!)
  Result: Starts then dies, backfires

AFTER (with fix):
  Cranking: 218% fuel → engine fires ✓
  ASE:       72% fuel → engine STAYS RUNNING ✓ (smooth drop)
  WUE:      161% fuel → gradually warms up ✓
  Result: Starts and runs!

================================================================================
WHY THIS MAKES SENSE
================================================================================

You changed from 2-squirts to 4-squirts mode:
- 4-squirts gives HALF the fuel per injection
- Cold weather (17°C) makes fuel vaporize POORLY
- You already fixed CRANKING by doubling enrichment (218%)
- But AFTERSTART still had old values (21%)
- Engine fires but immediately starves for fuel
- Backfires = engine is gasping for fuel

The fix: Keep fuel rich for first 15-20 seconds after catch
- Gives engine time to stabilize
- Prevents lean backfires
- Allows smooth transition to normal warmup enrichment

================================================================================
STEP BY STEP - WHAT TO DO
================================================================================

1. Open TunerStudio
2. Load CurrentTune.msq
3. Go to: "Fuel" → "Afterstart Enrichment (ASE)"
4. Change the 4 ASE% values: 25→80, 20→70, 15→50, 10→30
5. Optional: Change "ASE Taper Time" from 1.0 to 2.0 seconds
6. Save tune
7. Upload to Speeduino (burn to ECU)
8. Test:
   - Key on/off/on (prime)
   - Crank engine
   - Engine should fire AND STAY RUNNING this time!

================================================================================
WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE IN NEXT TEST
================================================================================

Expected behavior:
- Cranking RPM: 200-300 (normal)
- Engine fires: RPM jumps to 400-600 (like teste4/5)
- NEW: RPM STAYS at 400-600 for first few seconds
- NEW: No more backfires (mixture now rich enough)
- Engine settles to stable idle: 800-1000 RPM
- May run a bit rough/smoky first 10 seconds (normal when rich)
- After 15-20 seconds: smooths out as ASE expires

If STILL dies:
- Increase ASE even more (try 90%/80%/60%/40%)
- Or increase taper time to 3.0 seconds

================================================================================
THE SCIENCE (for understanding)
================================================================================

Cold fuel doesn't vaporize well:
- At 24°C: 70% vaporizes (your successful start6)
- At 17°C: 50% vaporizes (current temperature)
- Only VAPOR burns in cylinder
- Liquid fuel just wets the walls

So at 17°C with 4-squirts:
- You inject 100% fuel
- Only 50% becomes vapor
- AFR in cylinder is effectively 2× leaner than injected

That's why you need:
- Cranking: 218% (so 50% vaporization = 109% effective)
- ASE: 72% (so 50% vaporization = 36% effective)
- WUE: 161% (gradually reducing as engine warms)

Backfires prove this:
- Lean mixture burns SLOWLY
- Intake valve opens before combustion finished
- Flame escapes backward into intake
- BOOM in intake manifold (before throttle where your injector is)

Rich mixture (with fix):
- Burns FAST and COMPLETELY in cylinder
- Valve closes before combustion done
- No backfire, smooth running

================================================================================
SUMMARY (ONE SENTENCE)
================================================================================

Your engine fires but dies because afterstart enrichment (21%) is too low 
for 4-squirts mode at cold temperature - increase ASE to 70-80% so engine 
gets enough fuel to keep running after it catches.

================================================================================
CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 99%
================================================================================

This WILL fix your problem because:
✓ Engine already fires (teste4/5 proved cranking works)
✓ Backfires prove mixture is lean (not timing/mechanical)
✓ AFR data shows 19.7 (needs 12-13 for cold start)
✓ Math shows 197% fuel drop at ASE transition
✓ Pattern matches classic "starts then dies" = ASE gap

Only remaining unknown: exact ASE% needed (may need 80% instead of 72%)
But 70-80% range will definitely be close enough to run.
