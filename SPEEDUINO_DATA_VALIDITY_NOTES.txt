SPEEDUINO FUEL-ONLY ECU - DATA VALIDITY REFERENCE
================================================================================
Date: November 30, 2025
ECU: Speeduino 2025.01.6 (FUEL CONTROL ONLY - NO IGNITION CONTROL)
Ignition: Mechanical distributor with hall sensor (RPM input only)

================================================================================
REAL MEASURED DATA (TRUSTWORTHY FOR DIAGNOSIS)
================================================================================

✅ RPM               - Hall sensor from mechanical distributor
✅ MAP               - Manifold pressure sensor
✅ CLT               - Coolant temperature sensor
✅ IAT               - Intake air temperature sensor
✅ TPS               - Throttle position sensor
✅ Battery V         - Battery voltage measurement
✅ IAC value         - Commanded IAC stepper motor position
✅ PW (PW1-4)        - Commanded injector pulse width (what ECU tries to inject)
✅ Baro Pressure     - Barometric pressure (if equipped)
✅ Sync status       - Trigger wheel sync status
✅ Loops/s, Loops/rev - ECU performance metrics

================================================================================
FAKE/CALCULATED DATA (IGNORE FOR DIAGNOSIS - NOT REAL MEASUREMENTS)
================================================================================

❌ Advance (Current) - FAKE! Just repeats ignition table lookup values
                       ECU has NO ignition control or feedback
                       Mechanical distributor controls actual timing
                       This value is FICTION - ignore completely

❌ Dwell             - FAKE! Meaningless on fuel-only ECU
❌ Dwell (Measured)  - FAKE! No ignition control = no dwell measurement

⚠️  AFR              - Only real if wideband O2 sensor is connected
                       Verify sensor presence before trusting this data

================================================================================
DERIVED/CALCULATED DATA (BASED ON REAL SENSORS OR TABLE LOOKUPS)
================================================================================

⚠️  VE (Current)     - Looked up from VE table based on RPM/MAP
⚠️  VE1, VE2         - Table values, not measurements
⚠️  Duty Cycle       - Calculated from PW and RPM
⚠️  Accel Enrich     - Calculated from TPS rate of change (TPS DOT)
⚠️  Gego, Gair, etc  - Correction factors (calculated)
⚠️  AFR Target       - Table lookup value
⚠️  Lambda Target    - Converted from AFR target

================================================================================
SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS PROTOCOL
================================================================================

When analyzing datalogs for diagnostic purposes:

1. IGNORE "Advance" COLUMN COMPLETELY
   - It shows what the table says, not what the distributor does
   - Mechanical distributor has vacuum + centrifugal advance
   - Speeduino has ZERO visibility into actual ignition timing

2. FOCUS ON REAL SENSOR DATA
   - Does RPM reach proper cranking speed (200-400 RPM)?
   - What PW is commanded at current CLT?
   - What IAC position is commanded?
   - Does battery voltage drop excessively during cranking?
   - What are actual CLT/IAT readings?

3. COMPARE WORKING vs FAILING LOGS
   - Use same sensors (real data only)
   - Look for differences in:
     * RPM achieved
     * PW commanded
     * IAC position
     * Battery voltage
     * Temperature conditions

4. VERIFY SENSOR OPERATION
   - Cross-check sensor readings for plausibility
   - CLT/IAT should be close if engine cold
   - MAP should be ~100 kPa at key-on (atmospheric)
   - MAP should drop during cranking (~30-50 kPa)

KNOWN WORKING CONDITIONS (BASELINE DATA)
================================================================================

start5.csv - Successful start:
- CLT: 18°C
- IAC: 84 steps
- Conditions: Working start

start6.csv - Successful start:
- CLT: 24°C
- IAC: 93 steps
- Conditions: Working start

================================================================================
IMPORTANT CONFIGURATION NOTES
================================================================================

Hardware:
- Injector: Magneti Marelli IWM500.01 (2.0Ω actual, low-impedance)
- IAC: Stepper motor, 0 steps = FULLY OPEN, 165 steps = FULLY CLOSED
- Distributor: Mechanical with vacuum + centrifugal advance
- Ignition: NOT controlled by Speeduino (fuel-only ECU)

Datalog Artifacts:
- PW = 0.000ms in logs: Normal in 2-squirts mode (alternating fire pattern)
- Advance values: Fictional table lookups, not real timing measurements
